ok, so i downloaded fogleman's minecraft using pyglet... 
(here's the link: "https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft)
anyways, i use my own ai using chatgpt's engine, and recently, it stopped responding, and when i lokked at it's backup files, they where corrupted.
so, just weirded out a little bit, i simply deleted the files and redid what i did last time to create the ai, and just added more security measures.
little did i know, that ai i deleted was not gone forever.
or at least that's MY theory.
so i was playing this minecraft game some more when i stubled across this.
[see "what.jpeg"]
i was super freaked out, and i deleted all of the files and redownloaded the python minecraft, and everything was back to normal again.
this was 2 weeks ago.
i thought i'd post it so that people could see what ai (or just code) can do when it gets corrupted.
